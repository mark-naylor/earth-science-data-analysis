# earth-science-data-analysis

Welcome to the GitHub page for Earth Science Data Analysis. You will find here a repository of (hopefully) useful plots you may encounter during your first few years in an Earth Science Degree at Edinburgh. Each plot comes with example code in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, which you can download on to your own machine.
