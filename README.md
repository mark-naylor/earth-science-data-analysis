# earth-science-data-analysis

Welcome to the GitHub page for Earth Science Data Analysis. You will find here a repository of (hopefully) useful plots you may encounter during your first few years in an Earth Science Degree at Edinburgh. The data for each plot can be found in the Data Folder, and there is example code in the form of a Jupyter Notebook for each diagram, which you can download on to your own machine.
